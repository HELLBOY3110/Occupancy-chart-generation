                 Our project is titled "Classroom Allocation & Chat Generation." It is a web-based application 
                designed to facilitate classroom allocation and provide a chat platform for users. The project
                aims to streamline the process of assigning classrooms for various activities within an educational
                institution or organization.
                Overall, the project aims to simplify the process of classroom allocation, reduce manual effort,
                 enhance communication between users, and improve the overall efficiency of managing classrooms 
                 within an educational institution or organization.
